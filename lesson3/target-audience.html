        excited that she went and told all her friends so they could schedule a time to attend a class. Luckely, she and
        her friends were able to sign up as the spaces were taken up quiickly!

        Angela is looking to forward to her birthday on Saturday, becuase for the first time her family will be going on
        a camping trip. She wanted to stay close and not go too far so she went to the Todaywillbe website and check out
        the forecast for the nearest city of Preston, Idaho. According to the forecast it will be sunny, which is
        perfect for camping and going to the lake. She told her kids to pack for swimnsuits and not forget the

        to the store. She decided to post a hiring ad on the Todaywillbe website and recieve many applications to great
        canditates for this position.
