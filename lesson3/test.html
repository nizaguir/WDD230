  her friends were able to sign up as the spaces were taken up quiickly!

<h3>Scenario 4</h3>
<p>
  Elle would like to have a website for her boutique. She realized that it would be helpful because a lot of times
  her customers wouldnt know the times her store was opened and there was no way to know unless you physically go
  to the store. She decided to post a hiring ad on the Todaywillbe website and recieve many applications to great
  canditates for this position.
